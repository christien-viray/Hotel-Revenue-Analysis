Author: Christien Bryan Reyes Viray


###### Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking data to address critical business decisions regarding revenue performance and operational capacity. The analysis provides data-driven answers to key questions on revenue growth, parking lot infrastructure investment, and underlying market trends. Using SQL for deep data exploration and Power BI for clear, actionable visualizations, this analysis empowers hotel management to make informed strategic decisions.





###### Tools \& Technologies

Microsoft Excel - Initial data inspection and splitting multi-sheet workbook into individual CSV files

SQL - Data extraction and transformation from the hotel dataset

Power BI - Interactive executive dashboard for stakeholder reporting





###### Business Problem

The hotel management team lacks a clear view of performance metrics to guide strategic planning. They are faced with ambiguous year-over-year revenue reports, uncertainties about investing in parking lot expansion, and a need to understand broader market trends to stay competitive. Without a data-driven approach, the hotel risks missing revenue opportunities, misallocating capital, and failing to adapt to guest behavior changes





###### Business Questions

Is our hotel revenue growing by year?

Should we increase our parking lot size?

What trends can we see in the data?

###### Key Findings

* Hotel revenue was segmented by hotel type to track revenue growths for both hotels through the years 2018-2020. From the years 2018 to 2019, City Hotel and Resort Hotel saw positive growth in their revenue. City Hotel saw a 613% increase in their first year but declined about 33% the following year. Resort Hotel also saw a massive increase of 206% in revenue and also saw a decline of about 39% the next year. Overall both hotels saw strong initial growth followed by a notable drop in revenue. This could suggest possible future challenges to sustain revenue year-over-year



* The parking demand at City Hotel fluctuated over 3 years. From 2018-2019, the parking demand surged from 0.95% (185 spaces) to 1.29% (1384 spaces) but dropped in 2020 to 0.88% (532 spaces). This suggests that parking needs are inconsistent and further monitoring needs to be done before expanding the parking lot. Resort Hotel on the other hand had a consistent parking percentage over 3 years with percentages of 3.38% (1069 spaces), 3.74% (3686 spaces), and 3.49% (1700 spaces). Resort Hotel may not need a parking lot expansion at this time. However, Resort hotel may want to consider expansions if their parking demand continues to trend upwards and stays above 3.50% in future years.



* Resort Hotel revenue peaks during the summer months (July-August), aliging with seasonal vacation travel. This pattern was strongest in 2019 but is consistent across all observed years, including a diminished peak in 2020. Resort Hotel's revenue also consistently declines from September to May, suggesting the decline is due to acadmeic and business schedules. The dip in 2020 could have likely been attributed to the COVID-19 outbreak.



* City Hotel demonstrates a significant revenue spike during the fall (AUgust-November) of 2019, which potentially results in business travel, conferences, or seasonal city events. City Hotel's revenue remained relatively consistent throughout 2020. This indicates that it may have been more adaptable to pandemic-related disruptions, possibly due to higher demand of essential or business travel.
